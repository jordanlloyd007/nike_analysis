# Nike analysis - sample data from Kaggle
## Project objective 
Nike as a company has always been a staple in my casual attire for as long as I can remember. As a life long fan it was only right to start my data analysis portfolio with an analysis of a token favorite brand of mine,Nike. Sorced from Kaggle.com of course. This dataset was extracted from a joined dataset with Adidas data then analyzed for its KPIs and unanswered questions. I developed a comprehensive workbook in Excel, Creating multiple tables, dashboards, and pivot tables to analyze the data.
