# Nike Analysis - sample data from Kaggle
#### by Jordan Lloyd - Junior Data Analyst - Atlanta GA 
## Project objective 
Nike as a company has always been a staple in my casual attire for as long as I can remember. As a life long fan it was only right to start my data analysis portfolio with an analysis of a token favorite brand of mine, Nike. Sorced from Kaggle.com of course. This dataset was extracted from a joined dataset with Adidas data then analyzed for its KPIs and unanswered questions. I developed a dynamic comprehensive workbook in Excel, Creating multiple tables, dashboards, and pivot tables to analyze the data. 
## Dataset used
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaushiksuresh147/adidas-vs-nike

## Questions? (KPIs)
- What are the top 3 most viewed products today?
- What products are customer favorites and how do they compare to our other products?
- Create a dynamic dashboard that summarizes the data in one view
- What are the driving factors behind the discounted products?
- Create a dynamic dashboard summarizing the discounted products

## Process
- Created a Box and Wisker chart to check for anomalies
- Created a new worksheet titled "f.nike.discriptive"

- 
- This worksheet contains a statistical summary of Nike data. Also discounted product metrics
- Discovered the length of time the sample was taken
- Discovered the average review count was 8
- Created 2 new worksheets "c.nike.unbias"/Average +, and "d.nike.bias"/Below Average
- These two new worksheets would allow me the comfort to explore the deeper qualities of these two groups
- Created a new worksheet titled "e.nike.discount" 
- This worksheet contains a table of all records from the "b.nike.views" that contain a discount percent

- Preformed conditional formating on worksheets b. - e. using color scaling to get a quick feel for category variations
- Created a pivots table and charts in a new worksheet titled "g.nike.input" to answer the question of my analysis
- This worksheet will serve as input for dynamic dashboards and reports I plan to create in this analysis 
- "g.nike.input" includes all KPIs and valuble information collected for this analysis
- Create category boxes for "g.nike.input" worksheet including KPI's extracted from the "f.nike.discriptive"
